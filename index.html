She was 8 weeks old when we got her. Her owner was getting coffee and I started to pet her. The owner asked if I wanted to take her home. So I asked my parents if I could. They said no. I told them to at least come and see Bella and they agreed. After 5min with her they wanted to take her home. We have had her for 8 years.
